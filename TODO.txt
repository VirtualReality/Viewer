This is the TODO file for the Universe Viewer.  

Members of the Viewer Development Work-Group and of the partnered development teams can look at this to see what needs to be done still.

Each item when completed will have a (complete) next to it.

TODO:

- Viewer rebranding to the Universe Viewer brand.

- Backport upgrades from Singularity (this must happen first)

- Backport upgrades from Firestorm (this can only happen after successful backport of singularity upgrades)

- Update OpenGL to the latest version for better quality graphics.

- Change logos to the Universe Viewer Logos.

- Add complete support for mesh.

- Add new skins that are more futuristic.

- Update overall code to ensure compliance with current operating systems.
NOTE: Windows xp can handle .Net 4.0 However there is no known fix for Windows XP users
to integrate in .Net 4.5.  Additionally Most viewers will be upgrading to be built with
.Net 4.5 in the near future per LL standards for meeting protocol on Secondlife.  We will
try to make the Universe viewer smart enough to detect the operating system and run properly
regardless of the standards to ensure continued support for remaining Windows XP users.

- Add integrated roleplay combat HUD (Thanks to BriaKallista Starfinder).
NOTE: This should help reduce some lag seen on most grids where combat meters such as the 
widely used Gorean meter is used with compatibility with weapons used in roleplay.

- Add a mechanism to allow the viewer to know if it is connecting to a region based grid
or a planet based grid.
NOTE: This will ensure support for grids that are region based if the user chooses to log on to more
then one grid with the viewer.

- Add support for Aurora/WhiteCore (Var & Infinite regions and some other things used by this particular
platform).
NOTE: This will only come into play if the grid is a region based grid.  Virtual Universe, Second Galaxy, and related grids
running on the planet based system will not be affected by this as there will be no region boundaries.

- Add in method to tell the viewer how to decode planets.

- More will be added as we start going through code.
